Modular Arithmetic Engine (C++)
Project Overview

This project is a demonstration of modular programming principles and clean code architecture in C++. Rather than a monolithic design, this implementation utilizes function prototyping and decoupled logic to ensure the system is maintainable and scalable.

Engineering Focus

Following the philosophy that "we don't only build, we understand what we build," this project emphasizes:

Data Integrity: Use of the double data type for all arithmetic operations to ensure precision in quotients and products.

Error Analysis: Implementation of the cerr (Standard Error) stream to handle invalid menu selections, separating standard output from error reporting.

Logical Control: A structured switch-case system for efficient decision-making paths.

Technical Stack

Language: C++

Environment: Developed using Xcode on macOS, focusing on POSIX-compliant C++ standards.

Key Headers: <iostream>, <cmath>
